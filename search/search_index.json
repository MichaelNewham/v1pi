If you\u2019re not sure, or you want to connect to your home WiFi, look at wifi-setup . Then come right back. Step 4: Start it for the first time \u00b6 Safely remove your SD card, or call umount/sync on Linux, and put the card in the pi. Connect the printer and power it up. The first time the pi boots, it will do some work to expand the filesystem to the full SD card size, and generally setting things up. This takes a few minutes. Step 5: Connecting \u00b6 Connect to Hot Spot \u00b6 Info The default SSID is v1pi The default Password is ChangeMe The default ip is 10.3.141.1 . pi is 3.141. The default username/password for RaspAP is admin / secret The Hot Spot will show up with an ssid of v1pi and a connection password of ChangeMe . Your computer might complain that you don\u2019t have an Internet connection. That\u2019s normal. The pi doesn\u2019t have Internet. If you connect with this method, the pi\u2019s ip address is 10.3.141.1 Open http://10.3.141.1 The RaspAP UI has a username of admin and a password of secret . Change your password! See below. Connect Through Your WiFi \u00b6 The pi will get it\u2019s IP address from your router. If you know how to find the IP address from your router, then you can do that, and put http://<the ip address> in your browser\u2019s address bar. The pi will also advertise it\u2019s address via http://v1pi.local Macs: Just go there. Linux (including other pi\u2019s): Install avahi-daemon, and then go there. Windows: Check out Adafruit\u2019s guide Here Android: I haven\u2019t got a good way to do this from android, so I would ping v1pi.local from a computer, and see what address it\u2019s pinging, and put that in my android address bar. As a last resort, you can connect a monitor and keyboard. The pi will boot up to a login prompt. The prompt will print the different addresses that will let you connect to the pi. Step 6: Use it \u00b6 The landing page will give you a few sparse links to information about this image, and two options: Octoprint: Very mature server for 3D printers. There are a lot of great features, and plugins, but it\u2019s use case is 99% 3D printing. CNC.js: Simple, CNC interface. The Marlin support is especially new, but I\u2019ve been using it with grbl for a long time, and I love how simple and effective it is. RaspAP: Administration for the networking on the pi. Be careful, if you\u2019re editing this on the network and you break it, how will you reconnect to fix it? Also, make sure you change the passwords. Step 7: Change the Passwords \u00b6 The default login password is raspberry, which the whole world knows. Even if you don\u2019t know how to use the command line, other people do, and they can do nasty things to you. There are many many things to do to improve security, but number one is to change the passwords. Changing the SSH password \u00b6 Info The default username is pi The default password is raspberry It is common knowledge, you should really change it. You\u2019ll need to log into the pi to change the password. Connecting with an ssh client is the easiest way, after you know the ip address. Windows: putty.exe is an oldie and a goodie. Mac/Linux: ssh pi@v1pi.local If you can\u2019t get ssh to work, you can also log in using a keyboard and monitor. The default username is pi and the default password is raspberry Change the password by running the passwd command. There is no root password set, so you don\u2019t have to change it. Any super user actions can be done as pi with the sudo command. Changing the Hot Spot Password \u00b6 The hot spot default password is ChangeMe . Any device within range can connect, and find your pi, or the web interface, and control your pi, and your CNC machine. It gets worse if you think about an infected device being in range, and not just a panel van with an antenna on it. Warning Be really careful in the \u201cConfigure hotspot settings! It will sometimes change the interface, and if you save that, and restart, it will not show up again! Changing the password is easy, and will help you sleep at night.
